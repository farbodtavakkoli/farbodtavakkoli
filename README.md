## Introduction
I’m a data scientist currently working at AT&T, where I focus on pre-training and post-training large language models, including dense and sparse (mixture-of-experts) architectures, as well as embedding models for large-scale, production-grade telecom applications using ScalarLM. My work spans the full generative AI lifecycle from data curation and model architecture design to evaluation, deployment, and open-source enablement, with additional ad-hoc contributions in RAG, Graph RAG, agentic systems, knowledge graphs, and ontology design.

## Background & Applied Research

I began my career as a civil engineer, later specializing in transportation engineering, where my work focused on network demand optimization and pedestrian and cyclist safety. I subsequently transitioned into data science and applied research consulting, working across a wide range of domains including climate and environmental sustainability, public policy and social equity, healthcare and academic medicine, community development and housing stability, design and engineering innovation, and higher education and research. My work has involved partnerships with organizations such as Selected partners and institutions include [Texas Trees Foundation](https://texastrees.org/), [Child Poverty Action Lab](https://childpovertyactionlab.org/), [Builders of Hope CDC](https://www.bohcdc.com/), [UT Southwestern Medical Center](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/), [Hunt Institute for Engineering and Humanity](https://hunt-institute.org/), [Hyphae Design Lab](https://www.hyphae.net/), [Verdata](https://verdata.com/), [King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/), and [Southern Methodist University](https://www.smu.edu/).

## Research, Benchmarks & Evaluation

I actively work with and contribute to modern evaluation frameworks and benchmarks for language models, including benchmarks on which our models have achieved #1 rankings a total of 10 times across multiple evaluation cycles.
